<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chicken pilaf is a Turkish rice dish. However simple, don’t underestimate this recipe. In my opinion, the simplest recipes actually leave the best impressions. Thanks to the chicken broth, the rice turns out delicious.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups of rice</li>
    <li>1 cup of short vermicelli or orzo pasta</li>
    <li>5 cups of chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 lbs boiled chicken (baked, grilled, a sautéed chicken will work, too)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp clarified butter or unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1-1/2 cup cooked or canned garbanzo beans</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Shred or cut cooked chicken and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Wash rice until water comes out almost clear. Set aside to be used shortly.</li>
    <li>Add olive oil and clarified butter in a large frying pan or a large pot. Turn the heat on to medium-high.</li>
    <li>Add vermicelli and start cooking it by continuously mixing it. The vermicelli will be ready very quickly. Don’t go anywhere far. Saute the vermicelli until they turn brown.</li>
    <li>Quickly add washed rice and mix everything well. Make sure all the rice gets coated with oil. Add 2 tsp salt and saute the rice for another 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add chicken broth into the pot and bring it to boil. Add garbanzo beans and cook down the chicken broth until there is slight moisture remaining. Do not completely dry out the mixture.</li>
    <li>Add shredded chicken into the pot and mix everything well.Turn the heat down to simmer and cover the lid of the pot. Depending on the rice you are using and how much water it may take to fully cook, this process could take from 15-25 minutes. Royal basmati cooks pretty quickly apparently and it only took me about 15 minutes or a little less.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, slice 1/2 onion and caramelize it in 1/4 cup oil. This step is completely optional. However, crispy onions taste amazing with this pilaf. </li>
    <li>Once 15 minutes have passed, turn the heat off from under the pot. Give your pilaf a nice stir and get it ready to be served. As my boys mentioned above, having some extra chicken broth is a good idea to serve alongside the pilaf.</li>
